# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## TicketConnect - Event Ticket Reselling Platform

### 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** TicketConnect  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Project Type:** Full-stack web application for peer-to-peer ticket reselling

#### 1.1 Vision Statement
Create a trusted marketplace that connects ticket holders who cannot attend events with people looking to purchase tickets, facilitating safe and transparent ticket reselling transactions.

#### 1.2 Problem Statement
- Event ticket holders often cannot attend events due to unforeseen circumstances
- Secondary ticket markets are often overpriced or unreliable
- No centralized platform for peer-to-peer ticket transactions with proper verification
- Difficulty in finding specific tickets for sold-out events

#### 1.3 Solution Overview
A web-based platform that enables users to list tickets for resale and browse available tickets with detailed filtering options, user authentication, and transaction management.
